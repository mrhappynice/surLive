### Lesson Plan: Gathering Data & Training a Model with LLM Assistance

**Objective:**  
Learn how to collect a dataset, pre-process it, and train a model—using modern tools and LLMs to simplify the process.

---

#### 1. Define Your Goal
- **Decide your task:** For example, text classification, sentiment analysis, or question answering.
- **Clarify outcomes:** What questions will your model answer?

---

#### 2. Gather Your Dataset
- **Online Datasets:**  
  - Visit platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or public repositories to download data.
- **Web Scraping:**  
  - Use Python libraries like **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** to extract data from websites.
- **LLM Assistance:**  
  - Ask an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) for tips on reputable sources or to outline a scraping plan.

---

#### 3. Pre-process Your Data
- **Clean the Data:**  
  - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format text uniformly.
- **Structure Data:**  
  - Save your cleaned dataset in a common format (CSV, JSON).
- **LLM Help:**  
  - Query an LLM: “How do I clean a dataset in Python?” for simple code examples.

---

#### 4. Set Up Your Environment
- **Install Python & Libraries:**  
  - Ensure you have Python installed (using Anaconda can simplify package management).
  - Install essential libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn transformers
    ```
- **Choose a Notebook:**  
  - Use Jupyter Notebook or any code editor to write and run your scripts.

---

#### 5. Explore Your Data with LLMs
- **Ask Questions:**  
  - Use an LLM to understand data trends and get insights (e.g., “What are common cleaning steps for text data?”).
- **Plan Analysis:**  
  - Let the LLM guide you on visualizing data distributions or identifying key features.

---

#### 6. Train Your Model
- **Select a Pre-trained Model:**  
  - For text tasks, models like DistilBERT or BERT are accessible and powerful.
- **Example Code (Using Hugging Face Transformers):**
  ```python
  from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
  from datasets import load_dataset

  # Define model and tokenizer
  model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

  # Load and tokenize your dataset
  dataset = load_dataset("imdb")  # replace with your dataset
  def tokenize(batch):
      return tokenizer(batch['text'], padding=True, truncation=True)
  tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize, batched=True)

  # Set training arguments and trainer
  training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./results", num_train_epochs=2, per_device_train_batch_size=8)
  trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized_dataset['train'], eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset['test'])

  # Train the model
  trainer.train()
  ```
- **LLM Tip:**  
  - Ask, “How do I fine-tune a Hugging Face model?” for extra clarifications if needed.

---

#### 7. Evaluate and Query Your Model
- **Test the Model:**  
  - Run sample inputs to check performance.
- **Use LLMs:**  
  - Ask for advice on metrics (accuracy, F1 score) and for interpreting results.
- **Iterate:**  
  - Refine pre-processing or model parameters based on feedback.

---

#### 8. Deploy and Query Your Model
- **Create an Interface:**  
  - Use simple frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI** to set up a web service.
- **LLM Assistance:**  
  - Query an LLM for steps to build a basic API, e.g., “How do I deploy a model with Flask?”

---

#### 9. Reflect and Share
- **Review the Process:**  
  - Summarize key learnings and challenges.
- **Get Feedback:**  
  - Share your project and ask both peers and an LLM for improvement ideas.
- **Document:**  
  - Write a brief report detailing the process and results.
