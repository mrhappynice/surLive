# surLive - Survival repo of ways to make it out there. 

I am in the process of compiling information on wound care edible plants building with natural resources etc. 

This will be the repo for these resources live and a place to test out and get feedback on systems such as plant identification through object recognition companion apps to help
build structures and things like starting a fire, cooking food in the wilderness, etc.
